Hold up, goddammit, this thing
Alright, wait, hold on, Adam
This thing keeps falling off

Woo, doing it big, ah-ah
I'm the lyrical, mathematical genius
Splashing like lime juice, you've never seen this
Internationally known, the longest, the leanest
Shout-out to one José Nenis

I hit 'em with the rhyme and the rhyme don't stop
We got the beat and the beat go drop
The ping pong paddle make the battle go pop
Now take a look around this spot

I'm seeing every detail like an over-cranked camera
Sleestaks in the back say, "Damn ya"
You say, "I can't" and I say, "Why can't ya?"
Chopping the track in the in the land of [unverified]

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

There's a bird in here
That's my DJ, not Doctor Brassiere
Dropping bombs like a bombardier
Like cacao, it's a chocolatier

We're giving y'all a lil' slice of heaven
B Boys bringing it back to A7
Deal with the schism, ride on the rhythm
Sweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em

I'll stage a coup and usurp your position
'Cause, 'cause like a Mormon, I'm on a mission
We're audible-visible, cadence is lyrical
Got the mental and physical when the moment is critical

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

Ruff
Uh, Lee Majors come again

Like the Six Dil-Million Dollar Man
Woo, watch out
In the back of the bus, gonna bust
Lee Majors style

I said stop, watch how I flip
Bill Piedmont with the Kung-Fu grip
Haymaker, roundhouse, show can't continue
At the roller rink down in Virginia

Oh yeah, did I spill the beans?
I see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans
A Von Dutch cap, UGG boots to match
The word gets out, you can't take it back

I'm just a pause tape competition expert winner
Just a doggone long-armed tall yarn spinner
You want a battle? Easy now, star
My DJ's so nasty, he needs a sneeze guard

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this, you wanna take that
Wanna, wanna try this, wanna, wanna make that
You can't abide this, you wanna fake that
Take a look around you
