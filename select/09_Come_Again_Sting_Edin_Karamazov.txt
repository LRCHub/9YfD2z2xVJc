Come again
Sweet love doth now invite
Thy graces that refrain
To do me due delight
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to dine
With thee again in sweetest sympathy
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to dine
With thee again in sweetest sympathy

Come again, that I may cease to mourn
Through thy unkind disdain
For now left and forlorn
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die
In deadly pain and endless misery
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die
In deadly pain and endless misery

All the day
That sun that lends me shine
By frowns to cause me pine
And feeds with me delay
Her smiles, my springs that makes my joys to grow
Her frowns the winters of my woe
Her smiles, my springs that makes my joys to grow
Her frowns the winters of my woe

All the night
My sleeps are full of dreams
My eyes are full of streams
My heart takes no delight
